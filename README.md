### LSTM in Pytorch test

**Notes**

Typical multivariate time series prediction with LSTM

- created for reusability of some modules
- data pipeline can be easily transfered and reused later
- tran and val functions can also be transfered and reused later

Overall I like the modularity of pytorch design, has potential.
